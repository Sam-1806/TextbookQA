Question: What is overfitting in machine learning?

Answer: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and irrelevant patterns. This results in poor performance on unseen data.

Source: Machine Learning by Tom M. Mitchell, Chapter 3, Section 3.2

Additional Information: Techniques like cross-validation and regularization can help mitigate overfitting.
